# Explanation

- The strategy pattern is used when you have a family of related algorithms or behaviors, and you need to switch between them at runtime. The strategy pattern encapsulates the different behaviors in separate classes that implement a common interface or base class. The strategy pattern is useful when you have a fixed set of behaviors, but you need to switch between them dynamically based on runtime conditions.

### Code example explanation

- In this example, the DocumentHandler class is responsible for opening and saving documents, but it delegates the actual file handling logic to a separate DocumentStrategy object. The DocumentHandler class takes a DocumentStrategy object as a parameter to its constructor, and uses it to read and write files.

- The TextDocumentStrategy and MarkdownDocumentStrategy classes are the concrete implementations of the DocumentStrategy interface. They define how to read and write plain text and markdown files, respectively.
